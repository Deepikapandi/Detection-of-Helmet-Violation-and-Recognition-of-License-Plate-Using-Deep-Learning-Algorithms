Project Title: Detection of Helmet Violation and Recognition of License Plate Using Deep Learning Algorithms

Description:

This project aims to enhance road safety by developing a system that detects helmet violations among motorcyclists and recognizes vehicle license plates using advanced deep learning techniques. The system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection.

Key components of the project include:

1. Helmet Detection: The model is trained to identify whether a rider is wearing a helmet or not, utilizing labeled datasets of helmeted and non-helmeted riders. This real-time analysis helps in enforcing helmet laws effectively.

2. License Plate Recognition (LPR): An optical character recognition (OCR) module is integrated to extract and read license plate information from images captured by cameras. This feature can assist law enforcement in tracking traffic violations and enhancing vehicle identification processes.

3. Implementation and Results:The project involves preprocessing images, training the deep learning models, and evaluating their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Real-time processing capabilities are emphasized, making the system suitable for deployment in various traffic monitoring scenarios.

4. Potential Impact: By automating the detection of helmet violations and facilitating license plate recognition, this project contributes to improved traffic safety and efficient law enforcement.
